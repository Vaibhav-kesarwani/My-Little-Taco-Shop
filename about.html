                <h3>Taco Trivia</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>When did tacos first appear in the India?</summary>
                    <p class="about__trivia-answer">
                        There is significant debate about the origins of the Taco in Mexico, with some arguing that the
                        taco predates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico, since there is anthropological evidence that
                        the indigenous people living in the lake region of the Valley of Mexico traditionally ate tacos
                        filled with small fish. Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, Bernal DÃ­az del
                        Castillo documented the first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans, a meal which HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s
                        arranged for his captains in CoyoacÃ¡n.

                    <p>
                        Others argue that the advent of the taco is much more recent, with one of the more popular
                        theories being that the taco was invented by silver miners in the <time datetime="18th century">
                            18th century</time>, however the first mention of the word "taco" in Mexico was in the 1891
                        novel Los bandidos de RÃ­o FrÃ­o by Manuel Payno.
